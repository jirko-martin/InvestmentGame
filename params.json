{"name":"Investmentgame","tagline":"A MaDKit based implementation of the game theoretic investment game","body":"### Hello :)\r\n\r\nThis is InvestmentGame - a [MaDKit](www.madkit.org) (Java) based implementation of the well known _investment game_. This game structurally resembles the game theoretic prisoner's dilemma.\r\n\r\nThe software has originally been written to support Jérôme's master's thesis in psychology where it will be used to perform an experiment for studying empathy for pain.\r\n\r\nThe program's software architecture is motivated by a generic proposal on \"story-driven-development\" - the so-called \"Correlated Story\" pattern.\r\n\r\nThus the InvestmentGame project (besides its application in Jérôme's thesis) also serves as a proof-of-concept for a story-driven software development approach. More information on the Correlated Story pattern will follow soon (hopefully).   \r\n\r\n### Running the game\r\nYou should have [Java 7](http://www.java.com/de/download/) installed on your computer. \r\nTo run the game, simply download the Zip file, extract it to any folder on your computer's hard drive and then double-click on the file InvestmentGame.jar in the main folder after extraction.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\n* Martin Beckmann\r\n* Jérôme Rimpel\r\n* Jirko Kegler\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with the program?
