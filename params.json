{"name":"Investmentgame","tagline":"A MaDKit based implementation of the game theoretic investment game","body":"### Hello :)\r\n\r\nThis is InvestmentGame - a [MaDKit](www.madkit.org) (Java) based implementation of the well known investment game. This game structurally resembles the game theoretic prisoner's dilemma.\r\n\r\nThe program has originally been written to support Jérôme's master's thesis in psychology where it will be \r\nused to perform an experiment on empathy for pain.\r\n\r\nBy the way : The program's architecture is motivated by a generic proposal on \"story-driven-development\".\r\nThus the project also serves as a proof-of-concept for the proposed development approach. More information on this issue will hopefully follow soon.   \r\n\r\n### Running the game\r\nYou should have Java 7 installed on your computer. \r\nTo run the game simply download the Zip file, extract it to any folder on your computer's hard drive and double-click on the file InvestmentGame.jar in the main folder.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\n* Martin Beckmann\r\n* Jérôme Rimpel\r\n* Jirko Kegler\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with the program?
